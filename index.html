			<p> Hey, my name's Craig, if you haven't gotten that already. I'm and AGMP major and on my third year here at UCSC. I've programmed with HTML and CSS before, but am optimistic I'll be learning something new this quarter.
			</p>
			<p> I've had the privilege of being introduced to video gaming early on in life and it's been a fascination of mine ever since. I love just about everything that incorporates both design and engineering, and game design is a practice that includes such a wide variety of both computer engineering and deisgn/art that I find myself enamored by it. I play games just as much as I want to design them. While I have been quite busy this quarter, so I haven't been able to play much, I have been trying to finish <i>Darkest Dungeon</i> for quite a while now and I've been getting more into it recently.
			</p>
			<p> Apart from the nerd stuff (no shame in it, but it is still nerd stuff) I often hike around just about anyhwere. Whether it be suburbs, downtown, the woods, if it's walkable, you'll probably see me there at least once. It's my main stress reliever. Something about walking around without a real objective just mellows me out. The forest is probably my favorite scenery to saunter through, so Santa Cruz has been a real treat for the past couple years.
			</p>

			<p> I've had pets my whole life. Mostly dogs with one cat thrown into the mix, but I love both. Here on the right is the oldest one I got back home. He's pushing 13 right now and I love him dearly. He's a bull mastiff and he mainly sleeps around nowadays, especially on the couch.
			</p>
