	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p> The main point of this lab was to further production of the main HTML page, as well as develop the repository's file structure.
	</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> Most of the difficulty was in formatting the HTML's layout. I eventually resigned to leaving it in its primitive state.
	</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> I set this up just fine so that's nice. It was a nice preview and it's got me interested in what else is possible in CSS.
