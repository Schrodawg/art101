		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<h3>Craig Schroeder</h3>
		<p>My name is Craig Schroeder. I'm a third year AGPM major, and have been into games for a majority of my life<br>
			I often try to walk around just about anywhere as much as I can, and love to just sit and watch the world go by.

			Hello Internet, I am an exchange student from University College London here to study computer science and<br>
