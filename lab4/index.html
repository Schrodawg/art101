	<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>For the most part, there was little difficulty in this lab. The hardest part would go to thinking up a coding task that wasn't too in-depth and explainable.</p>
	<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Once again, very few obstacles arose. I forgot how I usually make French Toast which forced me to text my mother for help.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Well, overall it came out all right in my opinion. The lists are formatted in an organized manner and the pseudocode looks like code so that's nice.</p>
	<h3>Lists</h3>
	<h4>Making French Toast</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Get a somewhat large bowl for mixing</li>
			<li>Add a couple cups of milk (or prefered subsitute) and crack open two eggs into the bowl</li>
			<li>Begin mixing with a whisk</li>
			<li>Place a pan on the stove, spray with cooking spray and begin heating at medium temp</li>
			<li>Whip out your bread, preferably Texas Toast, and dip both sides of the toast into the mix</li>
			<li>Begin cooking both side of the toast to your prefered level of toasty-ness</li>
			<li>Once to your liking, place toast on plate and feel free to add either sugar, butter, or syrup</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
		</ol>
	<h4>Minesweeper Map Generator</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Ask for user input to choose board size</li>
			<li>Ask for another input for number of bombs</li>
			<li>For every bomb, randomly place one in a grid until all have been placed</li>
			<li>For every non-bomb tile, detect how many bomb tiles are touching it</li>
			<li>Assign non-bomb tiles a number based on how many bombs are nearby</li>
			<li>Print out the grid visually</li>
		</ol>
