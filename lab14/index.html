    <div id = "challenges"><h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Honestly my biggest challenge was finding work to debug. As pretentious as it may sound, I try not to submit work that isn't at the very least finished. It may not be impressive work or even noteworthy, but I always make sure to sumbit code that works.</p>

      <p>Well that was my problem so not much to write here. Oh, I did decide to go back to one of the labs that we completed prior to our introduction to jQuery and rework it with jQuery methods.</p>

    <div id = "results"><h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The lab right before we were introduced to jQuery was Lab 10, where we created various events tied to buttons. I rewrote all the basic DOM code with jQuery as seen below.</p>

      <img src = "img\lab14_debug_html.jpg" width= 75%>
      <p>Well, nothing was wrong with the original code to be frank. It was just inefficient. So I went back and spiced it up with jQuery, which allowed me the freedom to skip over making and element variable everytime I wanted to do, well anything really. Apart from my "button1" function, this code could have been only a handful of lines long.</p>
