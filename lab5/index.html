		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>My main problem was related to a wierd indent the JavaScript code had when linked into the index file. When opened in-browser the first line always was indented some 20px or so.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>When investigating the indent problem, I discovered that it was because the code was inheriting the indent from my "content" div class. I fixed the issue by removing this specific element from the linked code.</p>
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<div class=output>
				<code>
        	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</code>
			</div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>It's alright. Nothing crazy, but I still like my autumn-esque style so I'm going to keep it for a few more assignments at least.</p>
