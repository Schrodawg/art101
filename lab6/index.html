		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Overall, this was a very unproblematic lab, with my only problems lying in formatting the page layout.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I'm still figuring out the exacts when it comes to HTML layout, but using the "margin" method seems to get me the best results so far so I'll stick with it until I need to step it up.</p>
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<div class=output>
				<code>
        	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</code>
			</div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Not bad overall. Nothing crazy, but I think it's still neat and organized.</p>
