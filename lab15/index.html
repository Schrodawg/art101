      <p>Personally, APIs are a very tricky subject because I can't really <i>see</i> the data. Like, I know that it's set up perfectly and I have to trust it, but it's like a car. I know that machines and engineers plan out the process of giving me the working product, but I don't know how it works and that puts me off.</p>

      <p>One of the APIs I tried to use didn't have any documentation, so I tried my best to work with it, but it just didn't work out. The one I ended up using was fairly simple, and after getting the data from it I was able to stringify the results easily and call the required info when necessary.</p>
