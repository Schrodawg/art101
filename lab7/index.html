      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I've done something similar in Python last year and you could say there was some unintentional corssover and mistranslation sometimes.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>After getting the Python mix up out of the way, my main issue was some file linkage issues.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>I was able to get it all sorted out and make it so the output made all the letters lowercase excpet the starting letter. I also was able to define the "window.prompt" userName variable outside of the function and call it with parameters.</p>
