    <div id = "challenges"><h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Mainly, I had difficulty with setting up an array with dictionary-esque objects embedded within it. I was forgetting the very setup of Java objects, the key:value format that is. I was just putting the houses and their descriptions in curly brackets, seperated by commas.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "problems"><h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I wasn't sure how in-depth I wanted this lab to be. I eventually decided to put a bit of effort into it and did two of the four bonus tasks.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "results"><h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Five houses, all have descriptions, and I made use of the ".show()" method jQuery has which allows me to hide the fancier parts of output div.</p>
